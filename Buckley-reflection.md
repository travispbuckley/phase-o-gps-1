### What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	
1.		I was most struggling with what a push/pull actually was doing, file wise. Since its all on the cloud it was just hard to visualize the folder going up with certain changes, making the changes to the original, then being brought down with the changes.

### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

2.		The use of git fetch and git merge were clarified. Since i had always just been using git pull, i was confused about using 2 different commands to obtain the same results. But the GPS instructor really helped clarify that pull is typically used, but you can also fetch individually and merge the branch, or branches, as well.

### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

3.		I asked my guide about the difference between git pull and using fetch/merge. I also asked my partner for his views on the commands we were using. He gave a different viewpoint for some of them that made them more clear.

### What still confuses you about Git?

4.		The only thing that confuses me about git now is my mistakes. Sometimes i will accidentally forget to start a new branch. And ill start working, save, commit, and then i realize what i've done. I don't know exactly how that messes with my file. Obviously, the changes are saved, but woudn't there be a conflict in the github master? I could just push the changes regardless, but if im working in a group that could be detrimental. So how to go about fixing errors would be the most confusing for me.

### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

5.		It went great! My partner was prepared mentally with the knowledge of most of the git commands, as well as good use of the terminal. I think it was beneficial having someone watch what i was doing to catch mistakes, even simple spelling errors when working in the command line.
